## 开启配置

```sql
select * from setup_consumers;
```

events_stages_current :  记录了当前线程所处的执行阶段 

events_waits_current :  记录了当前线程等待的事件 

开启:

```sql
update setup_consumers set ENABLED='YES' where NAME in ('events_stages_current','events_waits_current');

```

重置表: (可能存在一些不用了的表，太过久远也会会在里面出现)

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_io_waits_summary_by_table;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage;
TRUNCATE TABLE table_lock_waits_summary_by_table;
```

清空表碎片

```sql
optimize table elab_db.im_log;
```

## 实时计算

### 查询当前实时执行SQL信息

```sql
SELECT
	CURRENT_SCHEMA AS '数据库名称',
	SQL_TEXT AS 'SQL样例',
-- 	COUNT_STAR AS '执行总数',
	(TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000) AS '执行时间(秒)',
	(LOCK_TIME / 1000000000) AS '锁等待时长(秒)',
	ROWS_EXAMINED as '查询扫描行数',
	ROWS_AFFECTED as 'DML影响行数',
	ROWS_SENT AS '返回行数',
	NO_INDEX_USED AS '未命中索引行数',
	DIGEST as '主键'
FROM
	performance_schema.events_statements_current
WHERE
	CURRENT_SCHEMA != 'information_schema'
	and DIGEST_TEXT not in ('SET `autocommit` = ? ','COMMIT ' )
	and TIMER_WAIT > 1000000000
ORDER BY
	TIMER_WAIT DESC;
```

### 查看实时等待事件触发

```sql
SELECT
	THREAD_ID as '线程编号',
	EVENT_NAME AS '事件名称',
	OBJECT_SCHEMA as '数据库名称',
	OBJECT_NAME AS '对象名称',
	(TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000) AS '等待时长',
	INDEX_NAME as '索引名称',
	OPERATION AS '操作类型',
	NUMBER_OF_BYTES AS '产生字节数'
FROM
	`performance_schema`.events_waits_history
where 
  OBJECT_TYPE = 'TABLE'
order by TIMER_WAIT desc
```

### 用户连接数

```sql
SELECT
	USER AS '用户',
	HOST AS 'IP',
	CURRENT_CONNECTIONS AS '当前连接数',
	TOTAL_CONNECTIONS AS '总连接数'
FROM
	`performance_schema`.accounts
order by CURRENT_CONNECTIONS desc
```

```sql
SELECT
	USER AS '用户', 
	CURRENT_CONNECTIONS AS '当前连接数',
	TOTAL_CONNECTIONS AS '总连接数'
FROM
	`performance_schema`.users
order by CURRENT_CONNECTIONS desc;
```

### IO纬度

逻辑纬度

```sql
SELECT
	OBJECT_SCHEMA AS '数据库',
	OBJECT_NAME AS '表名',
	COUNT_STAR AS '总IO次数',
	(AVG_TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000) AS 'IO平均耗时',
	(MAX_TIMER_WAIT / 1000000000) AS 'IO最大耗时',
	 COUNT_READ AS '读取次数',
	(AVG_TIMER_READ / 1000000000) AS '读平均耗时',
	(MAX_TIMER_READ / 1000000000) AS '读最大耗时',
	 COUNT_WRITE AS '写取次数',
	(AVG_TIMER_WRITE / 1000000000) AS '写平均耗时',
	(MAX_TIMER_WRITE / 1000000000) AS '写最大耗时',
	COUNT_INSERT AS '插入次数',
	(AVG_TIMER_INSERT / 1000000000) AS '插入平均耗时',
	(MAX_TIMER_INSERT / 1000000000) AS '插入最大耗时',
	COUNT_UPDATE AS '修改次数',
	(AVG_TIMER_UPDATE / 1000000000) AS '修改平均耗时',
	(MAX_TIMER_UPDATE / 1000000000) AS '修改最大耗时'
FROM
	`performance_schema`.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
where 
	COUNT_STAR > 10
order by COUNT_STAR desc;
```

### 索引纬度

查找使用度不高，但是已经建立的索引

```sql
SELECT
	OBJECT_SCHEMA as '数据库',
	OBJECT_NAME as '表名',
	INDEX_NAME as '索引名'
FROM
	`performance_schema`.`table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage` 
WHERE
	COUNT_STAR = 0 
	AND SUM_TIMER_WAIT = 0 
	and INDEX_NAME is not null
```

## 文件分析

### 反应表的压力

```sql
SELECT file_name AS file,
    count_read,
    sum_number_of_bytes_read AS total_read,
    count_write,
    sum_number_of_bytes_write AS total_written,
    (sum_number_of_bytes_read + sum_number_of_bytes_write) AS total
 FROM performance_schema.file_summary_by_instance
ORDER BY sum_number_of_bytes_read+ sum_number_of_bytes_write DESC;
```

###  **反映文件的延迟** 

```sql
SELECT (file_name) AS file,
    count_star AS total,
    CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_wait / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS total_latency,
    count_read,
    CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_read / 1000000000000, 2), 's') AS read_latency,
    count_write,
    CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_write / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h')AS write_latency
 FROM performance_schema.file_summary_by_instance
ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC;
```



## 等待事件分析

### 哪个等待事件消耗的时间最多

```sql
SELECT
EVENT_NAME,
COUNT_STAR,
SUM_TIMER_WAIT,
AVG_TIMER_WAIT
FROM events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name
WHERE event_name != 'idle'
ORDER BY SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC LIMIT 1;
```





## 表分析

### 表的读写延迟

```sql
SELECT object_schema AS table_schema,
       object_name AS table_name,
       count_star AS total,
       CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_wait / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') as total_latency,
       CONCAT(ROUND((sum_timer_wait / count_star) / 1000000, 2), 'us') AS avg_latency,
       CONCAT(ROUND(max_timer_wait / 1000000000, 2), 'ms') AS max_latency
 FROM performance_schema.objects_summary_global_by_type
    ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC;
```

### 表的操作频率度分析

```sql
SELECT object_schema AS table_schema,
      object_name AS table_name,
      count_star AS rows_io_total,
      count_read AS rows_read,
      count_write AS rows_write,
      count_fetch AS rows_fetchs,
      count_insert AS rows_inserts,
      count_update AS rows_updates,
      count_delete AS rows_deletes,
       CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_fetch / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS fetch_latency,
       CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_insert / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS insert_latency,
       CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_update / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS update_latency,
       CONCAT(ROUND(sum_timer_delete / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS delete_latency
   FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_table
    ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC ;
```

## 索引分析

### 索引使用状况

```sql
SELECT OBJECT_SCHEMA AS table_schema,
        OBJECT_NAME AS table_name,
        INDEX_NAME as index_name,
        COUNT_FETCH AS rows_fetched,
        CONCAT(ROUND(SUM_TIMER_FETCH / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS select_latency,
        COUNT_INSERT AS rows_inserted,
        CONCAT(ROUND(SUM_TIMER_INSERT / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS insert_latency,
        COUNT_UPDATE AS rows_updated,
        CONCAT(ROUND(SUM_TIMER_UPDATE / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h') AS update_latency,
        COUNT_DELETE AS rows_deleted,
        CONCAT(ROUND(SUM_TIMER_DELETE / 3600000000000000, 2), 'h')AS delete_latency
FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE index_name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY sum_timer_wait DESC;
```

### 全表扫描状况

```sql
SELECT object_schema,
    object_name,
    count_read AS rows_full_scanned
 FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
WHERE index_name IS NULL
  AND count_read > 0
ORDER BY count_read DESC;
```

### 没有使用索引的状况

```sql
SELECT object_schema,
    object_name,
    index_name
  FROM performance_schema.table_io_waits_summary_by_index_usage
 WHERE index_name IS NOT NULL
  AND count_star = 0
  AND object_schema not in ('mysql')
  AND index_name <> 'PRIMARY'
 ORDER BY object_schema, object_name;
```



## SQL分析

### 糟糕的SQL分析

```sql
SELECT (DIGEST_TEXT) AS query,
    SCHEMA_NAME AS db,
    IF(SUM_NO_GOOD_INDEX_USED > 0 OR SUM_NO_INDEX_USED > 0, '*', '') AS full_scan,
    COUNT_STAR AS exec_count,
    SUM_ERRORS AS err_count,
    SUM_WARNINGS AS warn_count,
    (SUM_TIMER_WAIT) AS total_latency,
    (MAX_TIMER_WAIT) AS max_latency,
    (AVG_TIMER_WAIT) AS avg_latency,
    (SUM_LOCK_TIME) AS lock_latency,
    format(SUM_ROWS_SENT,0) AS rows_sent,
    ROUND(IFNULL(SUM_ROWS_SENT / NULLIF(COUNT_STAR, 0), 0)) AS rows_sent_avg,
    SUM_ROWS_EXAMINED AS rows_examined,
    ROUND(IFNULL(SUM_ROWS_EXAMINED / NULLIF(COUNT_STAR, 0), 0)) AS rows_examined_avg,
    SUM_CREATED_TMP_TABLES AS tmp_tables,
    SUM_CREATED_TMP_DISK_TABLES AS tmp_disk_tables,
    SUM_SORT_ROWS AS rows_sorted,
    SUM_SORT_MERGE_PASSES AS sort_merge_passes,
    DIGEST AS digest,
    FIRST_SEEN AS first_seen,
    LAST_SEEN as last_seen
  FROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest d
where d
ORDER BY SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC
limit 20;
```
